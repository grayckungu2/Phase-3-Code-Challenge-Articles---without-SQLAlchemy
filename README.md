# Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Articles---without-SQLAlchemy
## Object Relations Code Challenge - Articles
This project  entails working with a Magazine domain.
There are three models: `Author`, `Article`, and `Magazine`.
For our purposes, an `Author` has many `Article`s, a `Magazine` has many `Article`s, and `Article`s belong to both `Author` and `Magazine`.
`Author` - `Magazine` is a many-to-many relationship.
